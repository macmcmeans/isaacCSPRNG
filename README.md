# isaacCSPRNG
ISAAC is a *cryptographically secure* pseudo-random number generator (CSPRNG) created by Robert J.
Jenkins Jr., in 1996, based on RC4. Designed for speed and security, ISAAC (Indirection, Shift, 
Accumulate, Add, and Count) generates 32-bit random numbers. Cycles are guaranteed to be at least 2^40 
values long, and they are 2^8295 values long on average. The results are uniformly distributed, unbiased,
and unpredictable unless you know the seed.

Internally, this implementation is mostly Rinquin's logic which appears to be quite similar, but not identical to,
Jenkins' original work (in C) which he released into the Public Domain. My contributions are a
namespace, so that separate instances may be created, as well as helper functions to spit out random
bytes, or random strings, of desired lengths. The int32, double and range methods expand the output options
from Rinquin's original random and rand methods. Since ISAAC is a CSPRNG, I also added helper functions 
to perform simple vernam encryption. As an academic option, I added the ability to save and set the
generator's internal state via JSON. Lastly, I made unseeded instances internally set themselves with a default
seed from Window.crypto values.

There are surprisingly few JavaScript examples of this CSRPNG. Considering it's over 20 years old, and 
has never been proven broken, one would expect more mention of it.

isaacCSPRNG is emoji-friendly üòÄüòÜüòäüòµ, which is to say that seeds, and cipher keys & messages, are multi-byte Unicode-safe.

Version 1.0<br>
Author: William P. "Mac" McMeans<br>
Date: 22 JUL 2017

## Application:
Use this to generate high-quality random numbers, and to encipher discrete messages (vernam). It also creates arbitrary
length byte arrays and text strings. 


## Dependencies:
None.
<br>&nbsp;<br>


## Period:
Average 2^8295; not less than 2^40
<br>&nbsp;<br>


## Example usage:

```
// return an instance of the generator initialized internally with Window.crypto (Monte Carlo)
> prng1 = isaacCSPRNG();

// return an instance of the generator initialized with a specified seed (deterministic)
> prng1 = isaacCSPRNG( 'this is a test' );


// return a 32-bit fraction in the range [0, 1]
> prng1.random();                                 -->  0.9519342305138707


// return a signed random integer in the range [-2^31, 2^31]
> prng1.rand();                                   -->  2052729692


// advance the generator the specified number of cycles
> prng1.prng( 6 );


// return an unsigned random integer in the range [0, 2^32]
> prng1.int32();                                  -->  288117856


// return a 53-bit fraction in the range [0, 1]
> prng1.double();                                 -->  0.4613288596233964


// return 32-bit range (inclusive) //
// from -27 to 400.65
> prng1.range( -27, 400.625 );                    -->  267.45789149729535

// from 0 to 100
> prng1.range( 100 );                             -->  37


// return an array of random bytes
> prng1.bytes( 10 );                              -->  (10) [192, 182, 240, 253, 228, 223, 55, 207, 168, 102]


// return a string of random 7-bit ASCII characters
> prng1.chars( 10 );                              -->  "-D:4<qTGPR"


// return vernam encryption of plaintext message, in hex format
> secret = prng1.encipher( 'key', 'message', 1 )  -->  "002900470041003b0021001e003f"

// return vernam decryption of ciphertext message, from hex-formatted data
> prng1.decipher( 'key', secret, 1 )              -->  "message"


// return vernam encryption of plaintext message (raw XOR)
> secret = prng1.encipher( 'key', 'message' )     -->  ")GA;!?"

// return vernam decryption of ciphertext message
> secret = prng1.encipher( 'key', secret )        -->  "message"


// export an object that stores the generator's internal state
> state = prng1.export();                         -->  JSON


// import an object that will set the generator's internal state
> prng1.import( state );


// zeroize the generator
> prng1.reset();


// re-seed existing generator (with a sample Gujarati phrase)
> prng1.seed( '‡™™‡´ç‡™∞‡™ø‡™ù‡™Æ ‡™∏‡™æ‡™á‡™´‡™∞' );


> prng1.random();                                 -->  0.22731631994247437


// re-instantiate the generator (with sample emoji and a script pseudo-alphabet)
> prng1 = isaacCSPRNG( '‚õÑ‚öΩüôàùìæùì∑ùì≤ùì¨ùì∏ùì≠ùìÆ' );


// range parameters can be given in either order
> prng1.range( 10, -20);                          -->  -15


// return ciphertext message, in hex (using Malayalam, Bengali, emoji and Unicode math symbols)

```
NOTE: Specifiying a seed on generator instantiation, or using the seed() method, or using either of the encipher() or decipher() methods will all produce the same effect of specifically setting the generator's internal seed. In the case of enciphering/deciphering, the key is the seed.
