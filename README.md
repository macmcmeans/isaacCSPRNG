# isaacCSPRNG
ISAAC is a *cryptographically secure* pseudo-random number generator (CSPRNG) created by Robert J. Jenkins Jr., in 1996, based on RC4. Designed for speed and security, ISAAC (Indirection, Shift, Accumulate, Add, and Count) generates 32-bit random numbers. On average, cycles are are 2^8295 values long, and are guaranteed to be at least 2^40 values long. The results are uniformly distributed, unbiased,
and unpredictable unless you know the seed.

Internally, this implementation is largely Rinquin's logic which appears to be quite similar to Jenkins' original work (in C) which he released into the Public Domain. My contributions are a namespace, so that separate instances may be created; as well as helper functions to spit out random bytes, and random strings, of desired lengths. Going further, my int32, double and range methods expand the output options from the orginal random and rand methods; and where Rinquin extends the String object, my version uses separate functions in lieu of extending the native prototype. Since ISAAC is a CSPRNG, I added logic to directly perform simple vernam (XOR) encryption. As an academic option, I created the ability to save and set the generator's internal state via JSON. Lastly, unseeded instances will internally set themselves with a default seed from Window.crypto values, which would be suitable for Monte Carlo simulations where deterministic output is not required.

There are surprisingly few JavaScript examples of this CSPRNG. Considering it's over 20 years old, and has never been proven broken, one would expect more mention of it.

isaacCSPRNG is emoji-friendly üòÄüòÜüòäüòµ, which is to say that seeds, cipher keys and plaintexts are multi-byte Unicode-safe.

## Application:
Use this to generate high-quality random numbers, and to encipher discrete messages (vernam). It also creates arbitrary length byte arrays and text strings. Note: This generator is cryptographically secure. If you don't need a secure generator then consider <a href="https://github.com/macmcmeans/aleaPRNG">ALEA</a> for your application, an RNG created by Johannes Baag√∏e having excellent statistical properties.


## Dependencies:
None.

## Period:
Average 2^8295; not less than 2^40

## Example usage:

```
// return an instance of the generator initialized internally with Window.crypto (Monte Carlo)
> prng0 = isaacCSPRNG();


// return a 32-bit fraction in the range [0, 1]
> prng0.random();                                 -->  some random value


// return an instance of the generator initialized with a specified seed (deterministic)
> prng1 = isaacCSPRNG( 'this is a test' );


// return a 32-bit fraction in the range [0, 1]
> prng1.random();                                 -->  0.9519342305138707

> prng1.decipher( 'key', secret, 1 )              -->  "message"


// return vernam encryption of plaintext message (raw XOR)

// return vernam decryption of ciphertext message

// import an object that will set the generator's internal state
> prng1.import( state );


// zeroize the generator
> prng1.reset();


// re-seed existing generator (with a sample Gujarati phrase)

```
NOTE: Specifiying a seed on generator instantiation, or using the seed() method, or using either of the encipher() or decipher() methods will all produce the same effect of specifically setting the generator's internal seed. In the case of enciphering/deciphering, the key is the seed.
